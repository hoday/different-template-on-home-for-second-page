# different-template-on-home-for-second-page
A Wordpress plugin for specifying a different template to use on the second page and onward of home

Wordpress uses the front-page.php template by default for displaying the front page of the site.
However, if the front page is set to show an archive of the most recent posts ("home"), some users may want to use the default archive.php template for the second page and onward. This plugin makes Wordpress use archive.php for the second page and onward.
